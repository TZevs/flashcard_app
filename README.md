# Flashcard App

I got the idea of this app from seeing my sister using flashcards to revise for her ALevels and saw how inconvenient it was to organise her different decks of flashcards. I thought that developing app that would allow her to store her cards and review them from her phone was the perfect way to help, and the idea also fit the criteria for my mobile development assignment.
